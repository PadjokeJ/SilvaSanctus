## Editing the code

All of the code in the repository is free for you to download, fork, sample and edit for personal use.  

### Disclaimer  

>None of the code is commented or documented, and nearly all of it is poorly optimised due to my lack of knowledge and to the fact that this project was a learning experience for me.

### How to

You will need to
[download](https://github.com/PadjokeJ/SilvaSanctus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
a copy of this code on your personal machine.
To edit this project and export it, you will need the
[Unity Engine](https://unity.com/).
Version `2022.3.18f1` is recommended, as it was the version I used to code this, and it is a relatively stable version. You can upgrade the editor, just know that it is recommended you backup this project before doing so. I recommend you use
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com/)
for code editing.

To add the code into Unity, launch Unity Hub and click on add. You can select either "Add project from disk", and select the code folder. You will need to have extracted the zip file containing the source code.  

![Add project from disk](Images/unity-add-from-disk.png)

Make sure you have the correct Unity version installed. You can then open the project by either clicking on it inside the Unity Hub, or find a specific Unity Scene in your file explorer and double click it.

### Requests

I ask that you keep all the code you have done only for personnal use. **Please do not sell any copies of this game.**
